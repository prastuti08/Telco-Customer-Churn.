# Telco Customer Churn Prediction  

This project predicts whether a customer will churn (leave the company) using machine learning techniques.  

## Dataset  
- Dataset: [Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)  
- Rows: 7043 | Columns: 21  
- Target Column: `Churn`  

## Steps in the Project  
1. Data Cleaning & Handling Missing Values  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ understanding patterns in churn  
3. Feature Encoding & Transformation  
4. Model Building (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
5. Model Evaluation & Results  

## Key Insights  
- Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn rate.  
- Electronic check payment method is most common among churners.  
- Customers with fiber optic internet service churn more frequently.  

## Tools & Libraries  
`Python`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`  

## Results  
- Achieved **81.4% accuracy** using Random Forest Classifier.  
- Logistic Regression achieved **79.2% accuracy**.
